## Features

1.  On/Off Toggle
2.  High Speed
3.  Real-time Correction: Automatically corrects errors and improves sentences as you type, eliminating the need for button clicks.
4.  Discreet Error Correction: Identifies and corrects subtle errors.

## Usage

1.  Enter your Gemini API key and enable the extension.
2.  The extension will automatically detect text boxes.
3.  After a two-second pause in typing, the text box will highlight in orange, indicating correction is in progress. Upon completion, the box will turn green, and the text will be corrected.

## Considerations

1.  Potential for Overly Rapid Correction: Corrections may occur before the user has finished composing a sentence.
2.  Incompatibility with WhatsApp
